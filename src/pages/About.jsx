          Hi, I’m <strong>Ravi Shyam Singh</strong> — a <strong>Full stack
          developer</strong> and <strong>backend-focused problem solver</strong>
          currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at
          Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education. I thrive on building
          robust, real-time platforms that keep users informed, productive, and
          secure.
        </p>

        <p style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.8)" }}>
          My projects range from a productio Java learning platforms
          to collaborative hubs powered by Socket.IO, Firebase-authenticated
           and simulation-heavy cryptography labs. Each build
          sharpens my focus on <strong>clean architecture</strong>,
          <strong> resilience</strong>, and <strong>measurable impact</strong> —
          whether that means automating alerts, reducing latency, or ensuring
          compliance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside the editor, I’m an avid hackathon participant and a constant
          learner who enjoys translating complex requirements into approachable
          experiences. I’m currently seeking opportunities to bring my mix of
          Java, Python, React, and DevOps tooling to teams that value
          craftsmanship and momentum.
        </p>
